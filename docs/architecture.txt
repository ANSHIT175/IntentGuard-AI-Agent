IntentGuard follows a security-first AI agent architecture:

User Input
   ↓
Intent Analyzer (Intent Intelligence)
   ↓
Risk Assessor (Impact Evaluation)
   ↓
Policy Engine (Runtime Enforcement)
   ↓
Action Simulation (Pre-execution Safety)
   ↓
Action Executor (Controlled Execution)
   ↓
Audit Logger (Compliance & Traceability)

Inspired by ArmorIQ's principle:
"Know the Intent. Control the Action."
