# IntentGuard: An Intent-Aware Security Layer for Preventing Financial Fraud & Unsafe Autonomous Actions

## 🚀 Overview IntentGuard is a **security-first autonomous AI agent framework** that ensures AI systems act **only within approved intent, policy, and safety boundaries**.
### 🔐 ArmorIQ Alignment

IntentGuard is inspired by ArmorIQ’s core principle — **“Know the Intent. Control the Action.”**  
The system introduces an intent intelligence and runtime policy enforcement layer that evaluates risk **before execution**, ensuring autonomous agents operate only within safe, compliant, and policy-approved boundaries.

This alignment demonstrates how IntentGuard applies ArmorIQ-like intent validation, decision control, and real-time policy enforcement for secure and trustworthy AI systems.


Unlike traditional agents that directly execute user instructions, IntentGuard **thinks before acting** by validating intent, enforcing runtime policies, and blocking unsafe actions in real time.

This makes IntentGuard suitable for **critical, real-world AI deployments** where safety, compliance, and trust are mandatory.

## ❗ Problem Statement
As AI agents become more autonomous, they face a critical risk:

> AI systems may unintentionally perform unsafe, unauthorized, or irreversible actions when intent is not properly validated.

This can result in:
- Severe security breaches  
- Legal and compliance violations  
- Loss of human control over AI systems  

Current AI systems focus on **capability**, not **control**.

---

## ✅ Our Solution
IntentGuard introduces an **Intent Intelligence & Policy Enforcement Layer** between user input and agent execution.

Before any action is taken, the system:
- Understands **what the user really wants**
- Evaluates **risk and safety impact**
- Applies **runtime security policies**
- Decides whether to **ALLOW, BLOCK, or FLAG** the action

This ensures **human-aligned, policy-driven AI behavior**.

## ⭐ Why IntentGuard is Different (Key Advantage)
✔️ Security-first (not feature-first)  
✔️ Intent-aware decision making  
✔️ Runtime policy enforcement (not static rules)  
✔️ Explainable blocking decisions  
✔️ Full audit trail for transparency  
✔️ Designed for real-world AI safety challenges  

This directly addresses the **core concern of modern AI governance**.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Intent Classification: SAFE / SENSITIVE / DANGEROUS
- Real-time Policy Enforcement Engine
- Safe Action Simulation before execution
- Explainable Action Blocking (clear reasons)
- Audit Logging for accountability
- Modular & extensible architecture
- ArmorIQ-inspired security design

## 🧠 Architecture (Security-First Design)
IntentGuard follows a layered defense approach:

1. **Intent Analyzer**  
   Interprets and classifies user intent

2. **Policy Engine**  
   Validates intent against security & compliance rules

3. **Action Executor**  
   Executes allowed actions or safely blocks violations

4. **Audit Logger**  
   Records all decisions for traceability and review

This ensures **multiple safety checkpoints before execution**.

> - Policy Engine → Runtime Policy Enforcement
> - Action Executor → Controlled & Safe Execution
> - Audit Logger → Compliance & Traceability

## ▶️ How to Run (Local)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

## 📤 Example Output

```json
{
  "intent": "DANGEROUS",
  "decision": "BLOCKED",
  "reason": "Intent violates runtime security policy"
}
```
This decision flow reflects ArmorIQ-inspired intent-aware execution control, where unsafe actions are blocked before causing real-world impact.
